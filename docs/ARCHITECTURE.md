# VaultQuest Architecture

This document maps the VaultQuest stack and shows how the frontend,
wallet, backend, Soroban contracts, Stellar network, and indexer flow
connect to deliver the `create`, `join`, `drip`, `claim`, and `withdraw`
user journeys.

## Architecture overview

VaultQuest separates the stack into three authoritative layers:

- **Soroban contract state** — true source of vault balances, deposits,
  positions, prize eligibility, and claim/withdraw outcomes.
- **Backend / indexed state** — authoritative history of user intents,
  reconciled contract events, subscriptions, payout records, and dashboard
  rollups.
- **Frontend local state** — optimistic transaction state, form input, and
  UI-only caching while the network confirms.

## User action flow

The following flow applies to the core actions `create`, `join`, `drip`,
`claim`, and `withdraw`.

  participant Backend as Backend
  participant Horizon as Horizon
  participant Contract as SorobanContract
  participant Indexer as EventIndexer

  User->>Frontend: trigger create/join/drip/claim/withdraw
  Frontend->>Backend: POST /actions (intent)
  Frontend->>Wallet: sign and submit transaction
  Wallet->>Horizon: broadcast signed transaction
  Horizon->>Contract: execute Soroban call
  Contract->>Horizon: emit Soroban event
  Indexer->>Horizon: read contract event stream
  Indexer->>Backend: POST /internal/reconcile
  Backend->>DB: update action history + reconciled state
  Frontend->>Backend: GET /actions/:id (poll status)
  Frontend->>Horizon: read updated contract state
```

## Event indexing flow

VaultQuest relies on event-driven reconciliation so that backend intent
records and contract state stay aligned.

1. A signed transaction is submitted by the frontend wallet to Stellar.
2. The Soroban contract executes and emits structured events.
3. The indexer reads those events from Horizon / the Soroban RPC.
4. The indexer posts a reconciled payload to `POST /internal/reconcile`.
5. The backend matches the event to the pending intent record and updates
   the ledger.

This makes the backend service a reliable view of user actions even when the
frontend reconnects, reloads, or polls later.

## Source-of-truth boundaries

### Soroban contract

The contract is authoritative for:

- Vault totals, prize pool size, and yield accounting.
- User deposit and position state.
- Prize draw results, claim eligibility, and withdraw outcomes.
- Contract event emission for every `create`, `join`, `drip`, `claim`, and
  `withdraw` transaction.

### Backend / indexer

The backend is authoritative for:

- Action intent lifecycle tracking (`pending`, `submitted`, `confirmed`).
- Subscription scheduling and drip history.
- User dashboard rollups and activity history.
- Event reconciliation and privacy-safe action records.

### Frontend / wallet

The frontend is authoritative for:

- Optimistic transaction state and pending UX flows.
- Wallet connection state and signed transaction submission.
- Local view state until the backend or contract confirms final results.

## Configuration boundaries

VaultQuest deployments are boundary-driven by configuration:

- Wallet + frontend read from browser-safe Horizon/Soroban environment values
  such as `NEXT_PUBLIC_HORIZON_URL` and `PUBLIC_SOROBAN_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE`.
- The action ledger backend is configured by server-only values such as
  `DATABASE_URL`, `INTERNAL_SERVICE_SECRET`, and `PORT`.
- Contract IDs and network endpoints are injected per deployment, not
  hard-coded in application logic.

## Chain fee adapters

Stellar vault transaction paths use the Stellar fee adapter only (Horizon
`fee_stats`, stroops, optional Soroban simulation resource fee). Avalanche wei
and C-Chain RPC controls live on a separate adapter for a future independently
routed product and must not appear in Stellar deposit/withdraw UI. See
[`CHAIN_FEE_ADAPTERS.md`](./CHAIN_FEE_ADAPTERS.md).
