## Startup configuration validation (issue #133)

Before the indexer worker starts, the backend:

1. StrKey-decodes every entry in `INDEXER_CONTRACT_IDS` as a contract (`C…`) ID — rejecting malformed values, account (`G…`) keys, duplicates, and whitespace-only lists.
2. Requires `SOROBAN_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` and calls Soroban RPC `getNetwork` against `SOROBAN_RPC_URL`.
3. Refuses to start (process exit) when the RPC passphrase does not match, or when contract IDs are invalid.

The configured passphrase must match the RPC's full passphrase exactly. Leading
or trailing whitespace is part of the network identity and is not trimmed for
comparison. Empty or whitespace-only configuration still fails before the RPC
probe. Whitespace around comma-separated contract IDs continues to be ignored.

`GET /health/indexer` includes the validated set:

```json
{
  "configured": true,
  "contract_ids": ["C…"],
  "network": {
    "passphrase": "Test SDF Network ; September 2015",
    "protocol_version": "21"
  }
}
```

When the indexer is not configured, `configured` is `false` and `network` is `null`.

## 1. System Overview

The Event Indexer is a background service that polls the Stellar/Soroban ledger for contract events emitted by VaultQuest pool contracts. These events are parsed and dispatched to the VaultQuest backend via the protected internal reconciliation endpoint (`POST /internal/reconcile`), which resolves transaction statuses in the database.

To keep track of sync progress and diagnose processing delays, the indexer periodically reports its checkpoint to:
* **Endpoint:** `POST /internal/checkpoint`
* **Authorization:** Secure service-to-service header token (`X-Service-Auth`).

The backend stores this in the `indexer_checkpoints` database table. A public health interface is available at `GET /health/indexer` to calculate sync lag dynamically.

---

## 2. Sync Lag Metrics & Alerts

Sync lag is calculated dynamically by checking the last successful sync time and comparing the current ledger sequence with the indexer's processed sequence.

### Health Status Definitions

| Status | Threshold / Condition | User & Ops Impact | Action Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Healthy** | Success sync < 5m ago, zero errors. | Real-time txn updates. | None. Normal operation. |
| **Lagging** | Last successful sync > 5m ago, but no reported hard errors. | Updates delayed by a few minutes. | Low priority. Monitor. |
| **Degraded** | Hard error reported (`last_error` is not null) or sync lag exceeds critical limits. | User-facing deposits/claims block. | Immediate investigation required. |

### Alarm Thresholds

* **Warning (Soft Lag):** Sync lag sequence > 100 ledgers (~8.3 minutes on Stellar).
* **Critical (Hard Lag):** Sync lag sequence > 500 ledgers (~41.6 minutes) OR `status == "degraded"` (persistent error reported).

## 3. Troubleshooting & Recovery Procedures

If the indexer reports a `lagging` or `degraded` state, follow these diagnostic steps sequentially:

### Step A: Inspect the Indexer Health Status
Run a query against the health endpoint to gather current statistics:
```bash
curl -X GET https://api.vaultquest.io/health/indexer
```
Example Degraded Output:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "status": "degraded",
    "latest_ledger": 1492023,
    "last_sync_time": "2026-05-30T03:00:00.000Z",
    "last_success_sync_time": "2026-05-30T02:45:00.000Z",
    "last_error": "Horizon RPC rate limit exceeded (HTTP 429)",
    "sync_lag": 180,
    "message": "Indexer reported error: Horizon RPC rate limit exceeded (HTTP 429)"
  }
}
```

### Step B: Common Failure Modes & Solutions

#### 1. Horizon RPC Rate Limiting (429)
* **Diagnosis:** `last_error` contains `rate limit` or `429`.
* **Resolution:** 
  1. Inspect the Horizon API keys or RPC endpoint settings in the indexer environment (`.env`).
  2. If using a public RPC node, switch to a dedicated premium node provider.
  3. Adjust the indexer polling delay configuration to reduce request frequencies.

#### 2. Re-entrancy or Out-of-Sequence Event Parse Failures
* **Diagnosis:** Indexer fails repeatedly on a specific ledger block due to bad payload serialization.
* **Resolution:**
  1. Note the ledger number (`latest_ledger`) where the indexer is stuck.
  2. Inspect the indexer container logs for parsing errors.
  3. If safe, perform a manual skip or rewind by updating the checkpoint sequence (see Manual Ledger Rewind below).

#### 3. Database Connection Pool Exhaustion
* **Diagnosis:** Indexer logs show `PrismaClientInitializationError: Can't reach database`.
* **Resolution:**
  1. Check database server load and active connection count.
  2. Increase connection pool size parameters in `DATABASE_URL` (e.g., `&connection_limit=20`).
  3. Restart the backend Fastify server to clear stale connections.

## 4. Operational Commands (Manual Interventions)

### View Current Checkpoint in Database
Connect to the database via `psql` or Prisma Studio and query the database directly:
```sql
SELECT * FROM indexer_checkpoints WHERE id = 'singleton';
```

### Manual Ledger Rewind / Reset
If the indexer needs to re-process transactions from a past block due to missing/dropped events or database state sync issues:

1. Pause the event indexer service process.
2. Update the `latest_ledger` to the desired past block sequence:
   ```sql
   UPDATE indexer_checkpoints
   SET latest_ledger = 1490000, 
       last_error = NULL, 
       last_success_sync_time = NOW()
   WHERE id = 'singleton';
   ```
3. Restart the event indexer service. It will resume processing events starting from ledger `1490001`.

## 5. Security & Access Control

* The `/internal/checkpoint` and `/internal/reconcile` routes MUST always be guarded by a secure service auth key.
* Ensure that the `X-Service-Auth` token configured in the indexer matches `INTERNAL_SECRET` in the backend environment. Never expose this key in client-side bundles.
